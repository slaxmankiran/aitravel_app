## Competitive Positioning Statement

> **VoyageAI is the only AI travel planner that answers "Can I actually go?" before wasting your time planning.**
>
> While Mindtrip makes beautiful itineraries and Layla learns your preferences, neither tells you that your Indian passport needs a 3-week Schengen visa process, or that your $2,000 budget won't cover visa fees + flights + hotels for 14 days in Europe.
>
> **VoyageAI = Certainty First, Then Planning.**
